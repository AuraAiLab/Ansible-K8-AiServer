## NVIDIA GPU Operator Not Installing Correctly

### Description
The Ansible playbook k8-final2.yml is attempting to install the NVIDIA GPU Operator, but the installation is failing silently. When checking the target server (192.168.20.10), the gpu-operator namespace exists but no pods are running in it, and no Helm release is installed.

### Expected Behavior
The NVIDIA GPU Operator should be installed properly, with all required pods running in the gpu-operator namespace.

### Current Behavior
The installation seems to fail but the playbook continues due to 'ignore_errors: yes' setting.

### Proposed Solution
Update the GPU operator installation task to:
1. Remove ignore_errors option
2. Add proper prerequisite checks
3. Enhance the Helm installation command with more robust settings
4. Improve validation steps
